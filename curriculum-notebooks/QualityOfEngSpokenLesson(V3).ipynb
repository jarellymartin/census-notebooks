Because of the Census, your neighborhood and city can improve education and transportation, promote public health, and use given money to make improvements. More services can be given to the elderly, new roads and schools can be built, and more job training centers can be maintained and established. *Everyone* benefits."

Additionally, the representative (or \"voice\") representing your community in local, state, and federal governments could change, because district lines are redrawn every time. Members of Congress, state legislators, and many county and municipal offices are elected by voters grouped into districts, and you could be voting for different people depending on how these lines are drawn.
