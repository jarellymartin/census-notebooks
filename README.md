# census-notebooks

Census Notebooks is a Jupyter Notebooks-based curriculm on data literacy and data science using U.S. Census data. This research project was developed by undergraduate students at UC Berkeley under the Data Science Discovery program in partnership with the West Big Data Hub Innovation Hub. 

`curriculum-notebooks` contains currently developed Jupyter notebooks focused on data literacy and statistics and incorporate our `censusnotebooks` package. The Jupyter Notebooks include the learning goal, outline, and background to teach a synthesized version of a data science skill (i.e., scatter plots, linear regression, etc.).

The `censusnotebooks` package allows teachers to utilize the interactivity of widgets and visualization packages in Python in clean, simple, and accessible Jupyter Notebooks meant for U.S. Census lesson plans. The `widgets` package consists of wrappers for most types of widgets including text boxes, multiple-choice, and sliders. The `visualization` packages currently supports wrappers for Matplotlib and Seaborn, although future iterations are planned to include more complex and animated packages suchas Plotly, Bokeh, and Folium.
