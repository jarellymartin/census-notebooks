Discovering US Census: Jupyter Notebook Curriculum Modules
Data Science Discovery Summer 2019

The `censusnotebooks` package allows teachers to utilize the interactivity of widgets and visualization packages in Python in clean, simple, and accessible Jupyter Notebooks meant for U.S. Census lesson plans. The `widgets` package consists of wrappers for most types of widgets including text boxes, multiple-choice, and sliders. The `visualization` packages currently supports wrappers for Matplotlib and Seaborn, although future iterations are planned to include more complex and animated packages suchas Plotly, Bokeh, and Folium.
